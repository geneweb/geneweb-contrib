# GeneWeb-contrib

Useful scripts for geneweb not included in official release to
be used with `gwrepl`.

Usually, using a script will be invocated using this pattern

```
cat script.ml | GWREPL_PPF=/dev/null GWREPL_NOPROMPT=1 gwrepl [arg1, ..., argN]
```

See README of each subdirectory for more details about each tool.
